A university (from Latin universitas 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic degrees in several academic disciplines.[1] University is derived from the Latin phrase universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".[2] Universities typically offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs.

The first universities in Europe were established by Catholic Church monks.[3][4][5][6][7] The University of Bologna (Università di Bologna), Italy, which was founded in 1088, is the first university in the sense of:

being a high degree-awarding institute.
using the word universitas (which was coined at its foundation).
having independence from the ecclesiastic schools and issuing secular as well as non-secular degrees (with teaching conducted by both clergy and non-clergy): grammar, rhetoric, logic, theology, canon law, notarial law.[8][9][10][11][12]

The University of Bologna in Italy, founded in 1088, is the world's oldest university in continuous operation.
Definition
The original Latin word universitas refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc".[13] As urban town life and medieval guilds developed, specialized associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights (these rights were usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or their towns) became denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.[14]

In modern usage, the word has come to mean "an institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly non-vocational subjects and typically having the power to confer degrees".[15] The earlier emphasis on its corporate organization is no longer the primary feature by which a modern university is recognised.[16]

The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in Western and Central Europe, where this form of legal organisation was prevalent and from where the institution spread around the world.[17]

Academic freedom
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom. The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the University of Bologna, which adopted an academic charter, the Constitutio Habita,[18] in 1155 or 1158,[19] which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today, this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".[20] This is now a widely accepted concept in international research. On 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum,[21] marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation. The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.

The Moroccan higher-learning institution Al-Qarawiyin, founded in 859 A.D., was transformed into a university under the supervision of the Ministry of Education in 1963.[22]
An early institution, often called a university, is the Harran University, founded in the late 8th century.[23] Scholars occasionally call the University of al-Qarawiyyin (name given in 1963), founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 859 CE, a university,[24][25][26][27] although Jacques Verger writes that this is done out of scholarly convenience.[28] Several scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin was founded[29][30] and run[22][31][32][33][34] as a madrasa until after World War II. They date the transformation of the madrasa of al-Qarawiyyin into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[35][36][22] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed "University of Al Quaraouiyine" two years later.[35]

Some scholars, including George Makdisi, have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the madrasas in Al-Andalus, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Middle East during the Crusades.[37][38][39] Norman Daniel, however, views this argument as overstated.[40] In 2013, Roy Lowe and Yoshihito claimed that the influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe requires a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context.[41]

Medieval Europe

Established in 1224 by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, the University of Naples Federico II in Italy is the world's oldest state-funded university in continuous operation.[42][43]
Although there are antecedents, the modern university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian tradition.[44][45] European higher education took place for hundreds of years in cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century.[46] In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the trivium – the preparatory arts of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic or logic–and the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.

The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception.[47] Later they were also founded by kings - but with prior papal approval.[48] (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by The residence of a religious community.[49] Pope Gregory VII was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral school
